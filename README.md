ElaraManager: Smart Contract Framework for Tokenized Asset Rights (BETA)

ElaraManager is a smart contract framework built on Ethereum that empowers developers to manage tokenized asset rights directly within their smart contracts. It simplifies the process of integrating legal functionalities and streamlines smart contract development.

Current Status:

BETA - This is an actively developed project. Functionality is still under development, and breaking changes may be introduced in future releases.

Key Features:

Manage tokenized asset rights (dividends, ownership, leases, renting, etc.) directly within smart contracts.
Reduce development time and gas costs through a single, unified framework.
Leverage Elara's APIs for seamless integration of legal functionalities.
Ensure future-proof contracts with easy upgrade capabilities.
Getting Started:

Refer to the project's documentation for comprehensive instructions on setting up the development environment, interacting with Elara's APIs, and building smart contracts with Elara. The documentation can be found here (link to be added after documentation is complete).

Prerequisites:

Basic understanding of Solidity smart contract development
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your development machine
A code editor or IDE familiar with Solidity development
